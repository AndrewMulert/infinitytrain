            <h3>Stream Now on... Nowhere</h3>
            <p>Initially released on Cartoon Network, Infinity Train soon became an HBO Max Original in August of 2020 with the release of its third book.
                But this didn't last long as the show was cancelled less than a year later in April of 2021. 
                While this meant that there wouldn't be any new episodes the show could still be streamed on the service.
                That was, until it was quietly removed in August of 2022 to the dismay of fans.</p>
            <p>"[...] Cartoon Network warned them not to do this as it would hurt relationships with creators and talent, 
                but they clearly do not care what any of this looks like publicly, much less about how we feel about it." <i>-Owen Dennis</i></p>

            <h3>What can I do to help bring Infinity Train back?</h3>
            <p>“...people talking about the show increases the value of it. So the fact that Infinity Train trended on twitter for 3 days after all this? That adds value. The fact that Infinity Train is now topping the charts on iTunes? That adds value. If it has more value, that means the people in charge will want to keep it or license it.” -Owen Dennis, Creator</p>

            <h3>Why was Infinity Train canceled?</h3>
            <p>Infinity Train was canceled shortly after Book 4 premiered, a direct result of the Warner Brothers-Discovery merger and subsequent restructuring. The reasoning was particularly frustrating: executives believed children couldn't relate to the planned Book 5 protagonist, an adult character named Amelia. While the show was aimed at a younger demographic, it had a notable appeal to all ages—an audience studios often struggle to acknowledge.</p>
